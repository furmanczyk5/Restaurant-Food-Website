                    <p>
                        Cooking is only as complex as you make it. Here are some 
                        fundamental techniques used in our recipes.

                        <h4>Pan-Frying</h4>
                        <p>
                            In a shallow, wide pan, heat about a tablespoon or two,
                            just enough to cover the bottom of the pan and keep your
                            food from sticking. When the pan is hot, place the ingredients
                            in the oil. If you wait too long, the oil will start to smoke.
                            Don't use burned oil, but rinse the pan and start over. Frying
                            cooks one side faster than the other, so you may need to turn
                            or stir your ingredients.

                        <h4>Boiling</h4>
                        <p style="clear:both">
                            Fill a tall pot with water and crank up the heat. The water
                            will start to form bubbles. When the bubbles float to the
                            surface pretty uniformly, the water is boiling. Add your
                            ingredients and leave them in for the specified amount of
                            time.

                        <h4>Roasting</h4>
                        <p>
                            Preheat your oven to the specified temperature. This can
                            take a while, so it's best to start preheating before doing
                            anything else. When the oven is preheated, place the
                            ingredients in for the specified amount of time.
