                                <li>Combine Cheddar, zucchini, carrot, onion, salsa, and jalapeno in a medium bowl.
                                    Spread onto slice of bread and top with the remaining slice of bread.</li>
                                <li>Heat canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place the panini in  
                                    the pan. Place a medium skillet on top of the panini to weigh it down. Cook
                                    the panini until golden on one side, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-
                                    low, flip the panini, replace the top skillet, and cook until the second side
                                    is golden, 1 to 3 more minutes.</li>
                            </ol>
